      This simple stick holder was designed in Fusion 360 and fabricated using 3D printed materials.
      I was heavily inspired by the washington monument and the reflecting pool beneath it, and I 
      wanted a single solid piece so that it can be fabricated very easily and not need supports.

        The final version you are seeing is the sixth iteration. A lot of the work I had to do was 
        regarding tolerances of the 3D printing. Also, I needed to brush up on my high school 
        geometry. In some of my preliminary napkin sketches you can see some kind of trigonomety
        I was doing to try and get the stick to hang over without being too long or short.
